My name is Steven Peterson, and I am a software engineer hailing from Oregon. I've always loved computers and
technology for as far back as I can remember. My earliest childhood memories are entering BASIC programs from
hobbyist magazines into my family's Apple IIe. I've been hooked ever since.

Beyond technology, I have a passion for reading, cats, and video essays.
