# AstroPaper 4.0

[AstroPaper 4.0 was released](https://astro-paper.pages.dev/posts/astro-paper-v4/) and the author did more than just
upgrade the package to Astro v4. There were some structural changes and a couple of new goodies were added to the
package. If you read my earlier post, you may remember me talking about [code snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets). The author has added a code
snippet to the package so Visual Studio Code users can automatically generate their frontmatter.

I'm sure glad I made a post detailing everything I did to get AstroPaper 3.0 working. It turned out to be very
useful in quickly setting up this new version. ðŸ˜… You might not notice many visual changes to the site, especially
since we were already running v4, more or less.

Thanks to [Sat Naing](https://github.com/satnaing) and all of the contributors for the hard work!
