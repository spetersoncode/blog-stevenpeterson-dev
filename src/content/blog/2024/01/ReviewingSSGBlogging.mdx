description: Detailing my search for the right Static Site Generator to run this blog
---

I've had the idea floating around in my head of starting a new blog for a couple of months. I don't necessarily want
to become a blogger or post constantly, but I do want to have a place to share my thoughts and work. I
especially want a place where I can share solutions to problems I've handled. Some of the hardest tech problems I've
dealt with were solved by a random person's blog. I would like to be that random person for someone someday.

## Requirements

My requirements for a blogging platform are straightforward. I need it to be static, fast, and straightforward to use.

1. **Static**: I don't want to have to worry about a backend or database. I need to be able to write all my posts in
   plain text and maintain them in a git repo.
2. **Fast**: I need the site to render quickly, perform quickly on the client, and be quick to deploy. I need to be
   able to quickly make adjustments to my content.
3. **Easy to use**: I need to be able to write my posts in Markdown. I need to be able to use my existing skills and
   tools to maintain my content and my blog. I don't want to have to learn a new language or use a new toolchain.

While those are my requirements, there are some other features that would be really nice to have.

1. **Deployment speed**: Having the deployed site perform as quickly as possible is a must, but I also want to be able
   to deploy quickly when I push a change to the remote repo.
2. **Flexibility**: I want to be able to add new features to the site easily. I want to be able to add new pages, new
   components, and new functionality without having to jump through hoops.
3. **MDX**: I want to be able to use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to write my posts. I want to be able to use TSX
   components in my posts, so I can add any functionality I want to my Markdown content.

## What I'm Using: Astro

![Astro Logo](@assets/images/2024/01/astro-banner.png)

The option I ended up taking is the JavaScript framework [Astro](https://astro.build/). Astro is a framework-agnostic
static site generator that works great with TSX components and TypeScript. It is built with static site
generation as a primary
concern, and it is quite fast. The first time I generated a site, I thought it failed because it ran so fast. Astro is
a pleasure to use, and it has a lot of great themes available to get you started. The themes are actually complete
Astro starter templates with developer tooling pre-configured by the theme author.

Astro blog content is written in Markdown documents with type-checked frontmatter. You can also add your own custom
type-checked elements. Astro has integrations to get MDX running, and many themes already have it installed. Astro blogs
are fully customizable with all the power of a full-fledged, mature JavaScript framework under the hood.

Because your content's frontmatter is type checked, there will likely be required fields. You should set up code
templates in your IDE to make it easy to create new posts. I use [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/), and I have a template set up to
create a new post with the required frontmatter fields already filled in.

### AstroPaper Theme ðŸŽ¨

Before settling on a theme, I looked at and played with quite a few of them. Regardless of my opinions of
individual themes, I am impressed with how quickly any of them can be turned around into a working blog with a long
list of modern features. I am also impressed with the effort and the care that theme maintainers obviously put not
only into the look and feel of their offerings, but the developer experience as well. I would like to specifically
call out [Astro Boilerplate](https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-boilerplate/) and
[Astro Cactus](https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-cactus/) as two themes that I really liked and almost went
with.

In the end, the theme I decided to go with is [AstroPaper](https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-paper/). I chose
AstroPaper because it is clear, clean, and lightweight. Unlike many of the other themes I looked at, AstroPaper does
not neglect the desktop experience and gives the content more room to breathe than most mobile-optimized themes. The
developer tooling is excellent, including Tailwind which is all but mandatory for me. AstroPaper is thoughtful in its
configuration options, and it works out of the box with very little configuration required.

That isn't to say that AstroPaper is without issues. For one thing, the latest version still uses Astro v3, while
Astro v4 is the version that is live currently. The author also decided not to include MDX, which I really wanted
to see in my winning solution at this point. None of these problems are beyond fixing, though, and in a future post
I will detail how I upgraded AstroPaper to Astro v4 and added MDX support.

### Issues with Astro ðŸ¤”

**Compiler and Linter Errors**

I have run into some issues that, while not show-stoppers, are annoying and worth mentioning. WebStorm is my IDE
of choice, and JetBrains does not play nicely with Astro as of this writing. It generates a lot of compiler and linter
false alarms. Some manual configuration is required to even make it functional, at least with the themes I have tried.

[The issues I experience are documented on YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-59503/IDE-shows-Corresponding-file-is-not-included-in-tsconfig.json-error-for-Astro-files-with-installed-typescript)
and JetBrains is working on it. As a workaround, someone suggested using the bundled Typescript interpreter rather than
the one that comes in the Astro package. This addresses many but not all the issues with strange errors.

I also noticed this warning when building my site (it scrolls by quickly)

```bash
07:58:31 [check] Getting diagnostics for Astro files in C:\Dev\Astro\stevenpeterson-dev...
WARNING: Checking `.jsx` and `.tsx` files is temporarily disabled due to an issue in the Astro language server and
TypeScript. See https://github.com/withastro/language-tools/issues/727 for more details. In the meantime, such files
can be checked using `tsc --noEmit`.
```

[Here is that issue link](https://github.com/withastro/language-tools/issues/727) for reference, it confirms there
are issues with Astro and TypeScript at the moment.

None of these errors actually prevent the site from building, but they are annoying and make it difficult to use the
IDE to its full potential. God help you if you try to run linter pre-hooks. I've learned to ignore the errors in the
IDE, which is a bad habit, but hopefully we can get some relief soon. This may or may not be an issue in VSCode, but
I am pretty invested into the JetBrains ecosystem, and VSCode comes with its own host of issues.

**Lack of Copy Buttons in Code Blocks**

Another annoying issue I hope to address in the near future is the lack of copy buttons in code blocks. I don't know
if this is to keep more JavaScript out of the client, but I consider it the key feature of a code block. This almost
kept me from accepting this solution as my final choice, but I'm sure there must be a way to add this functionality.

## Options Considered but not Taken

### Hugo

![Hugo Logo](@assets/images/2024/01/hugo-logo.svg)

Despite wanting to work with tools I am familiar with, and having no [Go](https://go.dev/) experience, I really wanted [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
to be the one that works for me. It has a huge community and a lot of themes available. However, I couldn't wrap my head
around it. I had trouble installing multiple themes, and Hugo is not out of the box ready for use. Figuring out how to
handle the EXE while not a huge challenge was a nuisance. Using a CLI to make a post seemed a bit much; I have an IDE
for frontmatter templates. This process probably feels better on Linux, which I am not using.

Hugo's biggest claim to fame is its speed in rendering static sites, and from what I can see, the reputation is
warranted. I do want something that goes from push to live quickly. However, for a static site generator which will be
the same speed after going live, this is an obvious "nice to have" and not a "must have." In some ways it's like buying
a sports car for your daily commute: sure it's nice to have the power, but how often are you really using it? That said,
I would quickly get frustrated with a site that takes forever to process.

In the end, Hugo didn't work for me, but that shouldn't stop you from checking it out.

### Jekyll

![Jekyll Logo](@assets/images/2024/01/jekyll-logo.png)

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a Ruby-based static site generator. It has been around a long time, and a lot of sites swear by it. By
reputation, Jekyll is a battle-tested workhorse. However, I am not familiar with Ruby and had a less than trivial
time getting it set up the way I wanted. Honestly, it's probably a great solution and it has stood the test of time.
At this point in my search, I was becoming more insistent that the solution use JavaScript (preferably TypeScript) to
leverage my existing skills.

### Gatsby

![Gatsby Logo](@assets/images/2024/01/gatsby-logo.jpg)

Moving on to JavaScript solutions, I looked at [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Gatsby is a React-based framework. It gets
mentioned a lot when it comes to static site generation, and it is certainly able to do that, but I did not find it to
be particularly suited to that task. In my experience with Gatsby, it appears to be a more general React framework with
an emphasis on interconnectivity. It seems like a great solution for building a live CMS-driven site, but I did not
find it to be a great fit for my needs. I also didn't find it to be particularly suited for blogging, out-of-the-box
or with an existing theme.

### Docusaurus

![Docusaurus Logo](@assets/images/2024/01/docusaurus-logo.svg)

Let me take a moment to say that I ðŸ¥° [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). It is a fantastic tool that I actively use to build
documentation sites and keep teams coordinated on their documentation needs. Docusaurus also has some out-of-the-box
blogging functionality that works quite well, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to someone who just wants to get
a blog up and running quickly. It even supports MDX, and I'm able to freely share my components between Astro and
Docusaurus. I find that it is very opinionated about how it wants to structure your content, and centered around the
documentation use case. It doesn't appear to lend itself well to simple customizations. It's a great tool for its
primary use case, but it's not a great fit for my needs in this case. That said, I can't overstate what a fantastic
"Documentation as Code" tool Docusaurus is. Check it out, use it; you won't regret it.

### Headless CMS (Sanity, Strapi)

One thing that kept popping up in my search for the ultimate blog platform was the concept of a "Headless CMS". It's a
fascinating concept. It does not line up with my requirements, but I had to
take a short detour to learn more about this world. I looked at two of the most popular headless CMS solutions:
[Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) and [Strapi](https://strapi.io/). I was impressed with both of them, and I think I'll
be returning to this concept in the future. I can see the utility in these solutions for sites which are live, dynamic,
and heavily content-driven. They seem like a natural pairing with Gatsby, which I mentioned earlier.
In the case of this blog, I want a static site with no moving parts, and I don't want to have to actually build the
"head" to go with my headless CMS. I'm sticking a pin in this for when I need it.

## Conclusion

I'm glad I took the time to explore the landscape of static site generators. I learned a lot about the options
available. However, I'm even happier I discovered Astro. It is a great solution that meets all my requirements
and has a lot of nice-to-have features. As Astro ventures into the realm of server-side rendering, I'm watching eagerly
to see where this promising young framework is headed and considering using it for a wider range of projects. I'm
looking forward to writing more about my experiences with Astro and sharing some of the neat things I've learned.
